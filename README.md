üìß MailCLI is a tool for sending fast, templated bulk emails via any SMTP server with CSV support.

## ‚ú® Features

- Efficient and customizable bulk email sending with templates.
- Easily integrates template attributes from CSV files.
- Compatible with any SMTP server for maximum flexibility.

### Why choose this over `cat | sed | sendmail < bcc distro_list`?

- Supports both plain text and HTML email formats.
- Leverages Go's powerful templating features, including conditionals and dynamic content.
- Addresses SMTP provider limitations by avoiding excessive BCC recipients (commonly over 1,000).
- Sends emails concurrently for improved performance and faster delivery.
